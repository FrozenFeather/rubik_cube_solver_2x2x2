# rubik_cube_solver_2x2x2
Rubik's Cube 2x2x2 Solver in Processing based on Iterative Deepening A*

Interaction:
Use Keyboard '0' to shuffle the cube
           SPACE to solve the cube

This project uses Iterative Deepening A* with a maximum depth 12.
If After 12 moves the cube is not solved, random introduce 5 moves and restart the IDA*
